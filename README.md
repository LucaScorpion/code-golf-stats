# Code Golf Stats

Statistics from the [Code Golf Stack Exchange](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com).

## Usage

First, make sure to copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`.
Here you need to set `SO_API_KEY` to your API key.

Run the script:

```shell
./get-stats.js
```

This will generate a JSON file in the `data` directory.

## Stack Exchange API

For more information about the Stack Exchange API, see their [API documentation](https://api.stackexchange.com).
